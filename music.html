        <h2>Here are the lyrics to Justin Bieber's Baby:</h2>
        <p>[Intro: Justin Bieber]
            Oh, woah
            Oh, woah
            Oh, woah
            
            [Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
            You know you love me, I know you care
            Just shout whenever and I'll be there
            You want my love, you want my heart
            And we will never, ever, ever be apart
            Are we an item? Girl, quit playin'
            We're just friends, what are you sayin'?
            Said "There's another," and looked right in my eyes
            My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like
            
            [Chorus: Justin Bieber]
            Baby, baby, baby oh
            Like baby, baby, baby no
            Like baby, baby, baby oh
            Thought you'd always be mine, mine
            Baby, baby, baby oh
            Like baby, baby, baby no
            Like baby, baby, baby oh
            Thought you'd always be mine, mine
            
            
            [Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
            Oh, for you I would have done whatever
            And I just can't believe we ain't together
            And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
            I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
            And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me
            And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
            I'm goin' down, down, down, down
            And I just can't believe my first love won't be around, and I'm like
            
            [Chorus: Justin Bieber]
            Baby, baby, baby oh
            Like baby, baby, baby no
            Like baby, baby, baby oh
            Thought you'd always be mine, mine
            Baby, baby, baby oh
            Like baby, baby, baby no
            Like baby, baby, baby oh
            Thought you'd always be mine, mine
            
            [Verse 3: Ludacris]
            (Luda)
            When I was 13, I had my first love
            There was nobody that compared to my baby
            And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
            She had me goin' crazy
            Oh, I was starstruck
            She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks
            She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
            At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
            She knows she's got me dazing, 'cause she was so amazin'
            And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'
            
            
            [Chorus: Justin Bieber]
            Baby, baby, baby oh
            Like baby, baby, baby no
            Like baby, baby, baby oh
            Thought you'd always be mine, mine
            Baby, baby, baby oh
            Like baby, baby, baby no
            Like baby, baby, baby oh
            Thought you'd always be mine, mine
            
            [Outro: Justin Bieber]
            I'm gone, yeah yeah yeah
            Now I'm all gone, yeah yeah yeah
            Now I'm all gone, yeah yeah yeah
            Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, gone, I'm gone</p>
